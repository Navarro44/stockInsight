The link to the functioning website is: https://jmnstockanalyzer.streamlit.app

The tools I used where:
1.) Beautiful soup to traverse the XBLR documents and retrieve necessary information.
2.) Streamlit, to facilitate the creation of the front-end website by using python, and the creation of the graphs.
3.) Llama2 as the LLM model to produce the text output, however, I had some trouble since I ran out of the tokens.
4.) Sec-edgar-downloader, to download the needed SEC 10-k filings.
5.) Pandas, to transform the information models into the functioning graphs.
